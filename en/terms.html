                By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.
                <h3>Using our Services</h3>
                You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
                <br><br>
                Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
                <br><br>
                Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.
                <br><br>
                Our Services display some content that is not Rewriter.Tools’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.
                <br><br>
                In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.
                <br><br>
                Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.
                <h3>Your Rewriter.Tools Account</h3>
                You may need a Rewriter.Tools Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Rewriter.Tools Account, or your Rewriter.Tools Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Rewriter.Tools Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.
                <br><br>
                To protect your Rewriter.Tools Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Rewriter.Tools Account. Try not to reuse your Rewriter.Tools Account password on third-party applications.
                <h3>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h3>
                Rewriter.Tools’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.
                <h3>Modifying and Terminating our Services</h3>
                We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
                <br><br>
                You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Rewriter.Tools may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.
                <br><br>
                We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.
                <h3>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>
                We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.
                <br><br>
                Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Rewriter.Tools nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.
                <br><br>
                Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.
                <h3>Liability for our Services</h3>
                When permitted by law, Rewriter.Tools, and Rewriter.Tools’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
                <br><br>
                To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Rewriter.Tools, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).
                <br><br>
                In all cases, Rewriter.Tools, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
                <br><br>
                We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.
                <h3>About these Terms</h3>
                We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
                <br><br>
                Payment made for the characters is non-refundable and goes to cover the costs associated with the payment of services of third-party services.
                <br><br>
                If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
                <br><br>
                These terms control the relationship between Rewriter.Tools and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
                <br><br>
                If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
                <br><br>
                If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
